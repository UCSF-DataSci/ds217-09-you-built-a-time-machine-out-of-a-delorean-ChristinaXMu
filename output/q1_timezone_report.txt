Timezone Operations Report

TODO: Document your timezone operations:
- The original data was in naive datetime format (no timezone info).
- To localize the data, I used tz_localize('UTC') to assign UTC timezone to the naive datetimes.
- The UTC-localized datetimes were then converted to 'US/Eastern' timezone using tz_convert('US/Eastern').
- UTC was chosen as the base timezone to avoid issues with daylight saving time (DST) transitions, which can create ambiguity in local times. 
By storing data in UTC, we ensure that all timestamps are consistent and unambiguous, as UTC does not observe DST.
- An example of a datetime before and after conversion:
  - Original UTC datetime: 2023-03-12 10:00:00+00:00
  - Converted Eastern datetime: 2023-03-12 05:00:00-05:00
- UTC is recommended for storing timestamps in multi-site clinical trials to maintain consistency across different locations and timezones.
Storing timestamps in UTC ensures calculations, comparisons, and merging across sites are unambiguous.
